# Churn Segmentation Modelling ANN

This is a complete Project that revovles around churn modelling and it contains every aspect from data cleaning down to model deployment. The data of a bank was used in this implementation and for modelling purposes an Artificial Neural Network was trained and used to predict the probability that a given customer would leave the bank(With 87% accuracy) and for deployment an API was developed which can be used for single prediction as well as batch prediction for a number of cutomers

> 'Churnâ€™ refers to the rate at which a subscription company loses its subscribers because of subscription cancellations or elapses. This leads to loss of revenue. Churn rates really matter for subscription businesses because they are an important indicator of long term success.

# Walkthrough:

## 1. About the Data:

### All the Data used in this Project is from Kaggle Churn Modelling Dataset  

- [Kaggle Dataset: Churn Modelling](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling)  

### File Description

- Churn_Modelling_Original.csv(The fulll dataset without any preprocessing)

### Data Fields

You can find more about the data [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling)

## 2. Data Cleaning: ([Data Cleaning Notebook](https://github.com/ITrustNumbers/Churn_Segmentation_Modelling_ANN/blob/master/Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.ipynb))

#### Outlier Detection:

> Box plots were used for the initial assesment of the data which concluded that two features 'Age' and 'CreditScore' might have outliers

![Box Plots](https://github.com/ITrustNumbers/Churn_Segmentation_Modelling_ANN/blob/master/Visualizations/Box_Plots.png)  

> Hence, I only considered these two features while treating for outliers.  
Also, we have a various methods to find the outliers. In this project i've used the IQR method but other options are:

    1. Z-score method
    2. Robust Z-score
    4. Winterization method(Percentile Capping)
    5. DBSCAN Clustering
    6. Isolation Forest
    
> Two data points were identified as outliers and were hence removed
